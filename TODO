Instead of always working with the file directly, e.g. with a bufwriter or the file itself,
work with the tasks vector and after modifying it, write it to file.
This would need a helper function to write the vector to the file.

Add function to open the todo file in a text editor, e.g. vim,
or read tasks from todo file and pipe them to a text editor where
the user can modify them and after saving write the changes to the todo file.
This should be like editing a commit message in git.
